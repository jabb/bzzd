libdrunkard
===========

Specialized drunkard's walk algorithm to procedurally generate all kinds of 2D maps.

Compiling
=========

If you're on Linux or Mac, a simple `make` should do compile everything nicely. And a `make install` should install the necessary files to use the library. If you're on Windows, I suggest MSYS or Cygwin and the above should work.

Examples
========

After compiling you can look at the example source files (in ./examples) and follow along to get a better understanding of the library.

Run ./examples/cave or ./examples/dung for very simple output.
